# TheMovieDB

This project is built on Xcode 10.3 and Swift 5 . I couldn't update my xcode because of the ongoing project in my current company . 

I have checked on different Xcodes and it's working fine so ideally you only have to unzip it and run it . If something bad happens. You can do the following things to run the project.

- Check is deployement target sets to 10.0 . You can find it in TheMovieDB target under General tab.
- Install and update the pods again

This project is based on MVVM follows clean architecture apporach .
